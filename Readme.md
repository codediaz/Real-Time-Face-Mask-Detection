# Real-Time Face Mask Detection with Python
The goal of a face mask detection system is to create an image recognition system that understands how image classification works, and it should work with great accuracy so that our model can be applied in the realtime situations. It will work by recognizing the boundaries of the face and predicting whether or not you are wearing a face mask in real-time.
